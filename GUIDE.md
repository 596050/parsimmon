Shorter example of how to parse with nested state (indentation levels, etc)

***

Some performance tips. Which constructions should be considered dangerous performance-wise?

***

Why there're so few negative constructions out of the box. I can count only notFollowedBy and noneOf. For example, I find myself lacking something like P.not:

```js
let line = P.noneOf("\n\r").atLeast(1).tie().desc("line")
// want something like
let line = P.not(P.end).atLeast(1).tie().desc("line")
```

README features custom notChar but I wonder if it's a bad style, or causes a bad performance â€“ that something like this is avoided in core API. Some sort of clarification would be great.

***

Separator position. Should you try to stick them to the low-level or high-level parser by default.
For example:

```js
let line = P.noneOf("\n\r").atLeast(1).tie().skip(P.end)
// vs
let line = P.noneOf("\n\r").atLeast(1).tie()
// vs
let line = P.noneOf("\n\r").atLeast(1).tie().lookahead(P.end)
```

My experiments suggests that the first version leads to design problems but maybe other people have different opinion.

??? Anything else
